 Simple simulation for Windows OS's swap process

The frame class represents a frame with pages and freezing ability.

Main instantiates _A_, _B_, and _C_ frames and logs the swap with 'A', 'B', 'C', '-', and '*' characters depending on if the page was loaded in one of the frames, it was already in one of them ('-'), or if every frame were frozen (asterisk).
